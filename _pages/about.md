I’m a PhD student at the [University of Zaragoza](https://unizar.es), under the Electronic Engineering program. My research interests are machine learning, deep learning and their implementation in low-spec devices. At the moment, I’m working in the edge computing of neural networks using FPGAs.

During my Masters Degree in physics and physical technologies at the University of Zaragoza, I worked in an early-stage FPGA implementation of a simple neural network, under the direction of [Prof. Medrano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ws4HMNsAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2) and Prof. Calvo.

I’m a proud member of the maker community. In my spare time, I love to work with arduinos and raspberries, and print some STLs with my 3D printers.
