  abstract={Automated instrumentation allows monitoring complex processes synchronizing the acquisition of physical magnitudes measured from different instruments. For this, standard communication protocols are used to send and receive both messages and data between the different components of the system. Most instrument communication protocols are based on wired standard buses, so that their application is restricted to relatively small environments, and the instruments mobility is limited. This work presents a Raspberry-based gateway which enables the wireless communication of an instrument, providing an IEEE 802.11 wireless link to Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) compatible instruments having a USB control bus. The compatibility of this proposal with the USB standard, available in a vast majority of the commercial instrumentation, allows its application in most of automated measurement systems. In addition, the use of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) as wireless protocol allows take advantage of a Wi-Fi infrastructure already deployed in the environment, or the use of a specific wireless network using a dedicated router if required. The proposed communications system has been successfully tested in a real scenario, measuring the signal propagation in a coaxial cable.},

  abstract={This demo presents a wireless automated measurement system based on a low-cost compact gateway developed in Python on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It has been designed for VISA compliant instruments having an USB control port. The gateway is plugged to the USB connector of the instrument, converting the strings sent from the measurement host via Wi-Fi into SCPI commands forwarded to the instrument through its USB port and vice-versa. As in the gateway, the application running on the measurement host is developed on Python. The system is tested measuring the velocity of propagation of a pulse traveling along a coaxial wire at different distant probing points.},

  abstract={Nowadays, most of the automatized measurement processes are carried out by VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) compatible instruments, that execute the instructions provided by a host computer connected through wired standard buses, as USB (Universal Serial Bus), GPIB (General-Purpose Instrumentation Bus), PXI (PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation) or Ethernet. To overcome the intrinsic limitations associated to these wired systems, this work presents an instrumentation control system based on the IEEE 802.11 wireless communications standard. Intended for instruments having a USB control port, this port is connected to a gateway based on a compact Raspberry Single Board Computer (SBC) and thus the instrument can be connected to the host computer via Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), easily allowing the deployment of an ad-hoc instruments communication network in the working area or its connection to a previously deployed general purpose WiFi network. Developed under Python, the operation commands, wireless link protocol, and USB connection allow two modes of operation to provide system flexibility: a live mode, where commands are sent individually from the host computer to the selected instrument; and a standalone mode, where a full measurement process can be entirely downloaded in the gateway to be autonomously executed on the instrumentation. The system performance in both operation modes, distance of operation, time latencies, and operating lifetime in battery operation have been characterized.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous development of more accurate and selective bio- and chemo-sensors has led to a growing use of sensor arrays in different fields, such as health monitoring, cell culture analysis, bio-signals processing, or food quality tracking. The analysis and information extraction from the amount of data provided by these sensor arrays is possible based on Machine Learning techniques applied to sensor fusion. However, most of these computing solutions are implemented on costly and bulky computers, limiting its use in in-situ scenarios outside complex laboratory facilities. This work presents the application of machine learning techniques in food quality assessment using a single Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip. The characteristics of low-cost, low power consumption as well as low-size allow the application of the proposed solution even in space constrained places, as in food manufacturing chains. As an example, the proposed system is tested on an e-nose developed for beef classification and microbial population prediction.},
